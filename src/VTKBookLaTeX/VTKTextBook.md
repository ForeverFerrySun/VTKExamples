# VTK Textbook - PDF Version

# Introduction

This is a PDF version of the VTK Textbook. That is fully cross-referenced, indexed and equations and figures have been updated where possible. Figures that exist as VTK examples can be periodically updated from the regression testing of these in VTKExamples.

You can download it from here: [VTKTextBook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorensen/VTKExamples/master/src/VTKBookLaTeX/VTKTextBook.pdf)
