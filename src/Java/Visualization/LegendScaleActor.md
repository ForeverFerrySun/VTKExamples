### Description

vtkLegendScaleActor object is used to annotate the render window. Its basic goal is to provide an indication of the scale of the scene. Four axes surrounding the render window indicate (in a variety of ways) the scale of what the camera is viewing. An option also exists for displaying a scale legend.

The axes can be programmed either to display distance scales or x-y coordinate values. By default, the scales display a distance. However, if you know that the view is down the z-axis, the scales can be programmed to display x-y coordinate values.
