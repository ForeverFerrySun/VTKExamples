vtkCursor3D is an object that generates a 3D representation of a cursor. 


The cursor consists of a wireframe bounding box, three intersecting axes lines that meet at the cursor focus, and "shadows" or projections of the axes against the sides of the bounding box. Each of these components can be turned on/off.
