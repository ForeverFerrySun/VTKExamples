### Description

vtkProbeFilter object is a filter that computes point attributes (e.g., scalars, vectors, etc.) at specified point positions. 

The filter has two inputs: the Input and Source. The Input geometric structure is passed through the filter. The point attributes are computed at the Input point positions by interpolating into the source data.
