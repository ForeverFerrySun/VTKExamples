Description: 

vtkPlaneWidget defines a finite (bounded) plane that can be interactively placed in a scene. 
The plane has four handles (at its corner vertices), a normal vector, and the plane itself. 
The handles are used to resize the plane; the normal vector to rotate it, and the plane can be picked and translated.
