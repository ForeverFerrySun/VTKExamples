### Description

The example creates an elliptical cross-section and stores it in a vtkPolyData. 
Then, the vtkLinearExtrusionFilter creates an elliptical cylinder by extruding the vtkPolyLine along a vector. 
The example sets the back-face property of the vtkActor to show the front and back face of the cylinder.
