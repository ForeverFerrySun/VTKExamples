### Description

vtkRuledSurfaceFilter object is a filter that generates a surface from a set of lines. The lines are assumed to be "parallel" in the sense that they do not intersect and remain somewhat close to one another. 

A surface is generated by connecting the points defining each pair of lines with straight lines. This creates a strip for each pair of lines (i.e., a triangulation is created from two generating lines). 

The filter can handle an arbitrary number of lines, with lines i and i+1 assumed connected.
