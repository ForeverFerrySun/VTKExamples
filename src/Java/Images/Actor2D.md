### Description

Example to demonstrate an actor that draws 2D data.

The object vtkActor2D is similar to vtkActor, but it is made to be used with two dimensional images and annotation. 

vtkActor2D object has a position but does not use a transformation matrix like vtkActor and it has a reference to a vtkMapper2D object which does the rendering.
