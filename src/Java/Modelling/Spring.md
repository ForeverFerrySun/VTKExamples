### Description

vtkRotationalExtrusionFilter object is a modeling filter. 

It takes polygonal data as input and generates polygonal data on output. The input dataset is swept around the z-axis to create new polygonal primitives. 

These primitives form a "skirt" or swept surface. For example, sweeping a line results in a cylindrical shell, and sweeping a circle creates a torus.
