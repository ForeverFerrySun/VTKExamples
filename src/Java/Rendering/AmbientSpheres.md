### Description

vtkLight object is a virtual light for 3D rendering. It provides methods to locate and point the light, turn it on and off, and set its brightness and color. 

In addition to the basic infinite distance point light source attributes, you also can specify the light attenuation values and cone angle.

These attributes are only used if the light is a positional light. The default is a directional light.
