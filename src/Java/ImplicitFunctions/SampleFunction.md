### Description

vtkSampleFunction is a source object that evaluates an implicit function and normals at each point in a vtkStructuredPoints. 

The user can specify the sample dimensions and location in space to perform the sampling. To create closed surfaces (in conjunction with the vtkContourFilter), capping can be turned on to set a particular value on the boundaries of the sample space.
