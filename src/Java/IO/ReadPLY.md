### Description

vtkPLYReader is a source object that reads polygonal data in Stanford University PLY file format (see http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep). It requires that the elements "vertex" and "face" are defined. 

The "vertex" element must have the properties "x", "y", and "z". The "face" element must have the property "vertex_indices" defined.
