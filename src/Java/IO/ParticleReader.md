### Description

vtkParticleReader object reads either a binary or a text file of particles. 

Each particle can have associated with it an optional scalar value. So the format is: x, y, z, scalar (all floats or doubles). The text file can consist of a comma delimited set of values. 

In most cases vtkParticleReader can automatically determine whether the file is text or binary.
