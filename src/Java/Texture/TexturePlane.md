### Description

vtkTexture is an object that handles loading and binding of texture maps. 

It obtains its data from an input image data dataset type. Thus you can create visualization pipelines to read, process, and construct textures. Note that textures will only work if texture coordinates are also defined, and if the rendering system supports texture.
