### Description

vtkTexturedSphereSource object creates a polygonal sphere of specified radius centered at the origin. 

The resolution (polygonal discretization) in both the latitude (phi) and longitude (theta) directions can be specified. It also is possible to create partial sphere by specifying maximum phi and theta angles.
