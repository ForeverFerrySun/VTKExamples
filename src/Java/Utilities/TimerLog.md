Description:

Example to Demonstrate Timer support and logging.
vtkTimerLog contains walltime and cputime measurements associated with a given event. 
These results can be later analyzed when "dumping out" the table.
In addition, vtkTimerLog allows the user to simply get the current time, and to start/stop a simple timer separate from the timing table logging.
