### Description

Example to Demonstrate Timer support and logging.

The object `vtkTimerLog` contains walltime and cputime measurements associated with a given event.

These results can be later analyzed when "dumping out" the table.
In addition, vtkTimerLog allows the user to simply get the current time, and to start/stop a simple timer that is separate from the timing table logging.
