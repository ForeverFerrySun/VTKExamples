### Description

 vtkRectilinearGrid object represents a geometric structure that is topologically regular with variable spacing in the three coordinate directions x-y-z.

To define a vtkRectilinearGrid, you must specify the dimensions of the data and provide three arrays of values specifying the coordinates along the x-y-z axes. 
The coordinate arrays are specified using three vtkDataArray objects (one for x, one for y, one for z).
